# Summary: Python dependencies for linting the codebase.
#
# This set of dependencies is split out from requirements-dev.txt so that
# GitHub Actions can load just this subset and not all the other
# requirements. (IGA has a huge list of requirements and they take a long
# time to install -- a needless waste of time when only running flake8.)
