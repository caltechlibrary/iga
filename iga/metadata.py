'''
metadata.py: metadata creation & manipulation

This file is part of https://github.com/caltechlibrary/iga/.

The code in this file constructs a metadata structure in the format expected by
InvenioRDM. It uses data provided in a GitHub release as well as the repository
(and files in the repository), but because GitHub releases and repos don't
directly contain the information needed, we have to resort to looking for and
parsing files in the repo to try to extract the info we want. The most useful
such files are codemeta.json and CITTATION.cff, but we resort to other things
if we can't find them.

CITATION.cff and codemeta.json overlap in their contents, so a natural question
is which one to try to use first. Stephan Druskat wrote the following about
them in https://github.com/citation-file-format/cff-converter-python/issues/4:

* "CodeMeta aims to, generally, provide a minimal schema for metadata
  for research software. It isn't necessarily tailored for citation metadata
  but can be used to provide metadata that can be used for citation."

* "CFF aims to provide a format for the explicit and exclusive provision of
  citation metadata for research software. Things like transformability to
  BibTeX and RIS have been taken into account. As such, CFF is both less
  comprehensive in terms of general metadata (although I will extend it to
  cover the whole key set of CodeMeta at some point), and more "detailed" in
  terms of citation metadata."

Since the use of InvenioRDM is more about archiving repository code than about
citing software, the code below looks for and uses codemeta.json first,
followed by CITATION.cff if a CodeMeta file can't be found.

# Constants.
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# It's useful to understand the context of what's going on. The record stored
# in InvenioRDM may have these top-level fields (but might not contain all):
#
# {
#    "$schema": "local://records/record-vX.Y.Z.json",
#    "id": "q5jr8-hny72",
#    "pid": { ... },
#    "pids" : { ... },
#    "parent": { ... },
#    "access" : { ... },
#    "metadata" : { ... },
#    "files" : { ... },
#    "tombstone" : { ... },
#    "created": "...",
#    "updated": "...",
# }
#
# However, what is uploaded to an InvenioRDM server should only contain the
# 'metadata' field, because of the other fields above are added by the system.
# Consequently, IGA only needs to construct the 'metadata' field value. I.e.,
# referring to https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/reference/metadata, we are only
# concerned with https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/reference/metadata/#metadata
#
# The following is the full set of possible subfields in "metadata".
