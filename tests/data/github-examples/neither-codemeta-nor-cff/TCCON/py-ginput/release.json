  "body": "This release includes (1) a license change and (2) fixes to allow ginput to run with Python 3.10.\r\n\r\n**License change** The license associated with ginput has changed from LGPL to Apache 2.0. If you download this software after 8 Sept 2022, the Apache 2.0 license is in effect.\r\n\r\n**Python update** The code has been updated to work with Python 3.10. If you install with `make install` or `./install.sh`, a Python 3.10 conda environment is created instead of a Python 3.6 one. If you need to work with Python 3.6, the `environment-py36.yml` file contains the previous 3.6 environment configuration, and can be use with `conda env create -f` to manually create a Python 3.6 environment."
