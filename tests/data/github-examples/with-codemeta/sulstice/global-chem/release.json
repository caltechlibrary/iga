  "body": "Bugs and Fixes Changes Implemented:\r\n\r\n- Bit Vectors have been removed as a core functionality. Standard fingerprints haven't been achieved yet and not yet worthwhile to store as fixed data. \r\n- Alternative Jet Fuels have been added in the Environment Section for SMILES and SMARTS\r\n- The FDA Colour Additive Bot Bug has been fixed where it was reading in the first row as data and not as headers. \r\n- READMEs in other languages have moved to its own directory\r\n- Social Guidelines like code of conduct and contributing guidelines have been moved to the social guidelines directory. \r\n-  The main README has been updated to be more focused on just the core network itself.",
