  "body": "* As of this version, a decoupling process related to some `mctq` utility functions will begin. Please pay attention to the deprecation warnings listed below.\r\n* Patch changes were made to `random_mctq()` to avoid warning messages due to [`lubridate`](https://github.com/tidyverse/lubridate) package updates.\r\n* The utility functions `assign_date()`, `cycle_time()`, `round_time()`, `shorter_interval()`, `longer_interval()`, `shorter_duration()`, `longer_duration()`, `sum_time()`, and `vct_sum_time()` are now deprecated.  These functions will be removed on the next `mctq` version. You can still find them in the [`lubritime`](https://github.com/giperbio/lubritime) package.\r\n* The utility function `qplot_walk()` is now deprecated. This function will be removed on the next `mctq` version. You can still find it in the\r\n  [`gutils`](https://github.com/giperbio/gutils) package.\r\n* `qplot_walk()` now uses `ggplot2::geom_bar()` or `ggplot2::geom_histogram()` to generate plots. It used `ggplot2::qplot()` before, now deprecated.\r\n* The `ggplot2` package was added as an import. It's needed while `qplot_walk()` remains on the package and will be removed from imports in the next `mctq` version.\r\n* Mario Pedrazzoli and Ana Amelia Benedito-Silva were removed as authors. They were Scientific Advisers that helped with the initial `mctq` development, but are not part of the `mctq` project anymore.\r\n* The Interdisciplinary Sleep Research Group (GIPSO) was removed as funder. GIPSO is a research group that Mario and Daniel Vartanian have built together. Daniel (the main author and copyright holder of `mctq`) is no longer part of this group. The \"funder\" status was always symbolic.\r\n* The dependencies versions were updated."
