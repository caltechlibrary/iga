  "version": "10.0.0",
  "identifier": "10.5281/zenodo.7574397",
  "description": "Simplifying data curation for researchers funded by the NIH SPARC initiative",
  "applicationCategory": "Scientific",
  "releaseNotes": "## Feature additions:\n\n- SODA for SPARC imports users' non-standard manifest columns (file name, timestamp, description, file type, additional metadata) app wide.\n- SODA for SPARC has new file standards for uploading to match the SDS.\n- SODA for SPARC uses the new Pennsieve Agent for uploading dataset files.\n- SODA for SPARC uses the Pennsieve API for communication with Pennsieve.\n- Manifest files are now edited through a new window rather than a pop up.\n- Manifests files have a new template styling that matches the SDS.\n- SODA for SPARC's tree view displays of users' dataset structures now list folders first then files alphanumerically.\n- Freeform Mode: The Organize Datasets feature's manifest file generator has been overhauled.\n- Guided Mode: Added the ability to edit an existing dataset on Pennsieve.\n- Guided Mode: Banner Images can be drag and dropped to be imported.\n- Guided Mode: File navigation is now only showing user file structure necessary to them rather the entire dataset structure.\n\n## Bug fixes:\n\n- Lazy Loading was added to editable manifest for large datasets.\n- Lazy Loading was added to editable manifest for large datasets.\n- Guided Mode: Fixed subjects and samples metadata not properly copying over when extra fields were added.\n- Lazy Loading was added to editable manifest for large datasets to prevent slowing down SODA.\n\n## Known Issues:\n\n- Freeform Mode:\n  - The transition to the generate step in the Organize Datasets feature is slowed when working with large datasets.\n  - Uploading large amounts of very small files ( <= 1kb ) will sometimes cause the upload to pause or crash. It is best to restart the upload when this happens.\n- When working with large datasets and trying to auto generate manifest files to edit. It can take some time and with no status indicator on the progress. (To be added)",
