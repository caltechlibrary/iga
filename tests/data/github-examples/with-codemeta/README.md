# Samples of GitHub repositories with codemeta.json files

I obtained these files on 2023-01-19 by doing a search on GitHub.com using the expression
```
path:**/codemeta.json
```

and then inspecting the first few pages of results, looking for examples that used licenses no more restrictive than ours (so, BSD 3-clause or MIT or better). I then saved the `codemeta.json` file, plus the JSON output of using GitHub's API to get the repository data and the latest release data. (The latter are stored in the files `repo.json` and `release.json`, respectively.)
